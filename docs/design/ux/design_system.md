## CSS Methodology
 To ensure consistency across the application and reduce duplication, common styles
 (such as button styles) have been moved to the global CSS file. Instead of using
 component-specific classes (e.g., `.greenregbtnOrganizationFundCampaign`, `.greenregbtnPledge`), a single reusable
 class (e.g., .addButton) is now applied.

### Benefits:
- Reduces redundant CSS code.
- Improves maintainability by centralizing common styles.
- Ensures consistent styling across components.

### Components:
This structre of styling can be followed accross all the components/screens for consistent design.

#### Search Bar:
